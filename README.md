 **Internship Machine Learning Tasks**
 
This repository contains solutions to 5 internship machine learning tasks. Each task includes data loading, EDA, model training, evaluation, and insights.

  **Task List**
  
 **1. Iris Dataset Visualization**
- Objective: Explore and visualize relationships between flower features
- Model: None (EDA only)
- Insights: Petal length and width are key in separating species

**2. Credit Risk Prediction**
- Objective: Predict if a customer will default on a loan
- Model: Logistic Regression & Decision Tree
- Metrics: Accuracy ~82%, Confusion Matrix shows balanced precision

**3. Customer Churn Prediction**
- Objective: Predict bank churn using demographics and account activity
- Model: Random Forest
- Metrics: Accuracy ~86%, SHAP shows age & balance most influential

**4. Medical Insurance Charges**
- Objective: Predict claim amounts using regression
- Model: Linear Regression
- Metrics: MAE ≈ $4,600, RMSE ≈ $5,700, Smoking & Age have strong effects

**5. Personal Loan Acceptance**
- Objective: Predict who will accept a personal loan offer
- Model: Logistic Regression & Decision Tree
- Metrics: Accuracy ~89%, Customers contacted via cellular with successful prior outcomes were more likely to accept


**How to Run**
Open each `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. Ensure required libraries (pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, matplotlib) are installed.
